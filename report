Question 1. (5 marks)
State the dimensions of complexity in DragonGame, and explain your selection.




Question 2. (5 marks)
Describe the components of your agent design for DragonGame.


Question 3. (15 marks)
Compare the performance of Uniform Cost Search and A* search in terms of the following statistics:
a) The number of nodes generated
b) The number of nodes on the fringe when the search terminates
c) The number of nodes on the explored list (if there is one) when the search terminates
d) The run time of the algorithm (e.g. in units such as mins:secs). Note that you can report run-times
from your own machine, not the Gradescope servers.
e) Discuss and interpret these results. If you are unable to implement A* search, please report and discuss
the statistics above for UCS only.


Question 4. (15 marks)
Some challenging aspects of designing a DragonGame agent are the asymmetric movement dynamics
(moving up behaves differently to moving down), the problem of choosing the order in which to visit and
collect each gem, and the large number of available actions.
Design and describe heuristics (or components of a combined heuristic function) that you have developed in
the search task that account for these aspects (or any other challenging aspects you have identified) of the
problem. Your documentation should provide a thorough explanation of the rationale for using your chosen
heuristics (maximum of 5 marks per heuristic).
